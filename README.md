A template for rapid & flexible DL experimentation development, built upon [Lightning](https://lightning.ai/) & [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) with best practice.

## What's New

***v1.0*** was released in 2022-12-06:

* Bumped to the latest Lightning v1.8
* Adopts Hydra for configuring
* ***Next:***
    * Applies [Loguru](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru) for logging
    * Building from config for useful callbacks

## Installation

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* PyTorch and torchvision would be better manually installed first refered to https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/.

## Usage

1. **Training**

    ```shell
    python tools/train.py [--config-name config[.yaml]] [trainer.devices=2] [datasets=cifar100] [data.loader.batch_size=16]
    ```

    * Override the default config file with `--config-name`.
    * You can also override any value in the loaded config from the command line, here are some common cases.
    * Refer to the following for more infomation.
        * https://hydra.cc/docs/tutorials/basic/your_first_app/config_file/
        * https://hydra.cc/docs/advanced/hydra-command-line-flags/

2. **Tips for Further Development**

    1. Note if you use any built in metrics or custom metrics that use TorchMetrics, these do not need to be updated and are automatically handled for you.
    2. To be continued ...
